__Sensorium__ is an in-development macOS application for monitoring for various events on a machine, and performing various reactions to those events.

Credit where credit is due, this app is heavily inspired by @dustinrue's excellent [ControlPlane](https://github.com/dustinrue/ControlPlane), and is something of a modern reimagining of the app. Dustin has stepped away from developing ControlPlane, and I've missed having the app to use, so I decided to finally just rebuild it.

## What's the name mean?

<dl>
	<dt>Sensorium</dt>
	<dd>The parts of the brain or the mind concerned with the reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli</dd>

## A Note on Maintenance

I have a full life outside of working on software, and this is just a hobby of mine. I make no guarantees of speed of development or addition of features. That said, I do want to make the app useful and valuable to folks other than myself, so don't hesitate to [open an Issue](https://github.com/hisaac/Sensorium/issues/new/choose) if you've got an idea, question, or issue to report.

## Notes to Myself

- Maybe a good persistance library: <https://mergesort.github.io/Boutique/documentation/boutique/>
